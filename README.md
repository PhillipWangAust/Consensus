# Consensus
Implements consensus algorithms on fixed and time varying graphs. This
is then used to present numerical results relating to the theoretical
work below and beyond.

For the theoretical results used consult *R. Olfati-Saber, J. A. Fax and R. M. Murray, "Consensus and Cooperation in Networked Multi-Agent Systems," in Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 95, no. 1, pp. 215-233, Jan. 2007.
